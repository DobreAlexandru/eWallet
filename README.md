# eWallet

This project is an attempt to showcase the digitalization of a physical wallet, built with React.


## Description


## Tech Stack

- **React** 
- **TypeScript** I look forward to learn more about TypeScript and felt that this project would be a good start.
- **Material UI** My preferred UI component library for this project. 
- **Framer Motion** Framer helped me create most of this app's animations. Reordering the items in the dashboard is a good use case for Framer Motion.
- **Firebase** I use Firebase as my go-to BaaS. In this project I've used features such as Authentication, cloud Storage and Firestore. Firebase is at the core of this app, allowing me to be able to store users and their data.
- **Stripe** Implemented a working payment functionality so the user could purchase transportation tickets within the app, while also following the rules and regulations of online payments, thus, keeping the app PCI compliant.
- **Vite** I chose Vite as my preferred build tool because of its Hot Module Replacement feature and quick build times
- **NodeJS** I've used Node.JS to be able to correctly implement Stripe's functionality. The server app is hosted on Heroku.
